= Error message "Retrieving the COM class factory failed" on startup =

== SYMPTOMS ==
Some users (the pattern appears to be people using non-english versions of Windows) are receiving the following error when starting the SkypePhone Manager:

*_Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {830690FC-BF2F-47A6-AC2D-330BCB402664} failed_*

== CAUSE ==
This problem is caused by the deployed Skype interop DLL not being compatable with your version of Windows

== RESOLUTION ==
To fix this issue:

 # Make sure you have the latest version of Skype. Download and install it from www.skype.com
 # Download the Skype4COM DLL from: http://skypephonemanager.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/SkypePhoneManager/Skype4COM.dll and put it in the same folder as the other SkypePhone Manager files (e.g. C:\SkypePhoneManager, or wherever you unpacked it)
 # Open a command prompt (Start / Run / cmd)
 # In the command prompt cd to the above directory (cd C:\SkypePhoneManager)
 # Run the following command: c:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe Skype4COM.dll

You should then be able to start the application without the exception occuring.
