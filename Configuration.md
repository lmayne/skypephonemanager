# Configuration and Useage #

## SkypeIn Functionality ##
  * To receive a SkypeIn call, someone will ring your SkypeIn number and the application will answer the call, play a voice message down the phone asking the user to wait, put them on hold and then ring your mobile. When you answer, the calls will be merged and taken off hold, and you can speak to the caller.

## SkypeOut Functionality ##
  * To make a SkypeOut call, make a skype call to your PC user from your SkypePhone. This will ring the number you set up in the forwarding section
  * To change the SkypeOut number from your mobile, send a chat message to your PC user from your phone containing the FULL phone number you want to ring (e.g. +44020123456). The application should change the setting and message you back when ready. This can sometimes take a while due to the Skype -> Three exchange.
  * If you have configured quick switch numbers, just send 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 as a chat message to the PC user to switch to this number
  * To list all the quick swich numbers you have configured, send a chat message to your PC user saying "contacts" (without the quotes)
  * To send an SMS through Skype, send a chat message to your PC user in the format:

sms (number) (message)

(number) can either be a full international number (e.g. +44201234567) or one of your quick switch numbers. For example:

sms +44201234567 Hello, how are things?

or

sms 1 Hello, how was your meeting?
